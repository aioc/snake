<p>
  The game of armada is played on a square grid, with a naval fleet
  of ships <b>trailing behind each other</b>, with each ship occupying
  one square on the grid. To begin with, your fleet contains five ships.
</p>

<p>
  You control your armada by commanding the head ship of the fleet to
  move up, down, left or right on the board. (Note that the head
  of the fleet cannot move into the rest of the fleet. That would
  surely cause a mutiny.) If the head of your fleet crashes into the
  sides of the board or into another used ship, be that in your own
  fleet or someone else's, your head ship will sink, and since the
  rest of the fleet are following the head... I'll leave the rest to
  your imagination. At this point, your fleet is eliminated from the
  game.
</p>

<p>
  It will likely serve as a strategic advantage to <b>extend your
  fleet</b>. This is achieved by guiding the head of your fleet into an
  <b>abandoned ship</b> (affectionately known as <b>food</b>). If you
  command the head of the fleet into an abandoned ship, it will become
  the new head ship of your fleet, and for that move, all other ships
  in your armada will remain stationary.
</p>

<h3>Victory</h3>

<p>
A armada is victorious once all the other armadas have been eliminated.

<h2>Interface</h2>

<p>Do <b>not</b> write a <i>main()</i> function, this is provided by the
<tt>armada_library.c</tt> object file.  The library will connect to the
server, and communicate with the server on your AI's behalf.  You must
implement the functions described below in your source file.</p>

<h3>Headers</h3>

<p>You'll need the following line to start with:</p>
<pre>#include "armada.h"</pre>

<h3>clientRegister</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientRegister()</i> is called when the client first logs on to the
  server.  You should call <i>setName(const char* name)</i> to define
  the name of your AI and <i>setColour(int r, int g, int b)</i> to
  elect a preferred colour. Names can be up to 16 characters long and
  colour components are between 0 and 255 inclusive.
</p>

<pre>void clientRegister(void) {
  setName("BlackPerl");
  setColour(41, 35, 52);
}</pre>


<h3>clientInit</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientInit(int numPlayers, int boardSize, int playerID)</i> is
  called at the start of a game.  The argument <i>numPlayers</i>
  specifies the number of players in this game. The
  argument <i>boardSize</i>   specifies the height/width of the game
  board, which is always square. The argument <i>playerID</i>
  specifies your player ID throughout the game. Any persistent data
  structures that you use throughout the course of a game are best
  initialised here.
</p>

<pre>void clientInit(int numPlayers, int boardSize, int playerID) {
    numP = numPlayers;
    size = boardSize;
    myID = playerID;

    // Initialise state...
    int i, j;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
        for (j = 0; j &lt; size; j++) {
            board[i][j] = -1;
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p><i>clientInit()</i> must return with one second.</p>

<h3>clientStartPositions</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientStartPositions(int playerID, int length, struct point* positions)</i>
  is called at the start of a game, after clientInit is called. It will be called
  once for each player in the game, informing the client of the
  positions of each of the ships in the player's armada. The argument
  <i>playerID</i> specifies the player whose fleet the function call refers to.
  The argument <i>positions</i> will be an array of points with <i>length</i>
  elements (<i>length</i> will always be 5). <i>struct point</i> is a
  type which contains two variables <i>r</i> and <i>c</i> indicating
  the row and column of the ship, respectively.
</p>

<pre>void clientStartPositions(int playerID, int length, struct point* positions) {
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i &lt; length; i++) {
        board[positions[i].r][positions[i].c] = playerID;
    }
    if (playerID == myID) {
        myHead = positions[0];
    }
}</pre>

<p><i>clientStartPositions</i> must return with one second.</p>

<h3>clientAddHead</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientAddHead(int playerID, struct point position)</i> is called
  before the client's turn.  It will be called once for each player in
  the game, informing the client of the new position of the head of
  each player's fleet. The player is indicated by <i>playerID</i> and
  the new head is indicated by <i>position</i>
</p>

<pre>void clientAddHead(int playerID, struct point position) {
    board[position.r][position.c] = playerID;
    if (playerID == id) {
        myHead = position;
    }
}</pre>

<p><i>clientAddHead()</i> must return with one second.</p>

<p>
  <i>clientRemoveTail(int playerID, struct point position)</i> is called
  before the client's turn.  It will be called at most once for each
  player in the game, informing the client of the movement of the tail
  of each player's fleet. The player is indicated by <i>playerID</i> and
  the previous position of tail is indicated by <i>position</i>
</p>

<pre>void clientRemoveTail(int playerID, struct point position) {
    board[position.r][position.c] = -1;
}</pre>

<p><i>clientRemoveTail()</i> must return with one second.</p>

<h3>clientPlayerDied</h3>

<p>
  <i>void clientPlayerDied(int playerID)</i> is called before the
  client's turn. It is called for each player who was eliminated in
  the previous turn. The argument <i>playerID</i> indicates the player
  id of the eliminated fleet.

<pre>void clientPlayerDied(int playerID) {
  int i, j;
  for (i = 0; i &lt; size; i++) {
       for (j = 0; j &lt; size; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] == playerID) {
                board[i][j] = -1;
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

<p><i>clientPlayerDied()</i> must return with one second.</p>

<h3>clientFoodAdded</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientFoodAdded(struct point position)</i> is called when a new
  abandoned ship appears on a square. The argument <i>position</i>
  describes where the new abandoned ship has been sighted.
</p>

<h3>clientDoTurn</h3>

<p>
  <i>clientDoTurn()</i> is called when it's your turn to make a move.  Do so by
  calling <i>makeMove(int direction)</i>.  Argument <i>direction</i>
  should be used to specify the direction that you wish your fleet's
  head to move in. (Note that directions are defined in armada.h as
  UP, RIGHT, DOWN and LEFT) If you call attempt to
  call <i>makeMove()</i> multiple times during your turn, only the
  last value will be  used. If you do not call <i>makeMove()</i>
  in <i>clientDoTurn()</i>, your client will be dropped from the game
  and will be recognised as having lost the game.
</p>

<p><i>clientDoTurn()</i> must return with one second.</p>

<pre>void clientDoTurn() {
    makeMove(DOWN); // Quick! Run away! As far down as we can go!
    // Note that this will either cause the head of the fleet to run
    // into itself if the head begins upwards relative to the next
    // ship in line, or it will eventually hit the bottom of the map if
    // it doesn't hit another ship first.
}</pre>

<h2>Example code / compiling your code</h2>

<p>Download <tt>armada_library.c</tt> and <tt>armada.h</tt>, along with an example AI and support libraries,
from <a href='armada_client_v1.zip'>here</a>.

<p>It is recommended that you use, from the command line, <tt>gcc</tt> to compile the library and <tt>g++</tt> to compile your code.</p>

<p>Use the following line to compile the library:</p>

<pre>$ gcc armada_library.c -c -o armada_library.o</pre>

<p>Use the following line to compile your code:</p>

<pre>$ g++ <i>your_file</i>.cpp armada_library.o -o <i>your_program</i></pre>

<p>Run the program from the command line like so:</p>

<pre>$ <i>your_program</i> <i>ip</i></pre>

<h2>Testing your code</h2>

<p>You can test your code by connecting to the main server &mdash; look at the title bar on the projector screen.</p>

<p>If you wish to run your own server, <a href="phais-studentjar.jar">download
    the server</a> and run it using "java -jar phais-studentjar.jar".</p>

<p>
To test your code, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run the server.
<li>Start each player.
</ul>

<p>
Type "<tt>help</tt>" to the server to find out more about the server.
